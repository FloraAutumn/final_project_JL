<h3>Running Around with a Jack Russell...<br><br>...Is like having a second life.</h3>

<h1>My Opinion</h1>
<p>
Every day, without delay, he would bring joy and trouble to each of us. Every night we would
be thankful for him being here. Without him, my life would not be as exciting and full of
wonders now. He always finds ways to charm his way into people's hearts when the time is
right and most of the time, he gives one space when they need it. Just by discovering him,
my family and I are growing closer each day!
