<h1>My Experience</h1>

<p>
			<li>In Fall of 2015, my father found a stray Jack Russell looking for food.</li>
			<li>The little fellow was able to charmed my family and me into keeping him.</li>
			<li>He was trouble at first because we did not know how to take care of a dog.</li>
			<li>Potty training him was one of the the worst problems.</li>
			<li>Figuring out what he can and cannot eat was another.</li>
			<li>By the end of that year, we grew fond of him and started to love him as family.</li>

<h1>My Opinion</h1>
<p>
Every day, without delay, he would bring joy and trouble to each of us. Every night we would
be thankful for him being here. Without him, my life would not be as exciting and full of
wonders now. He always finds ways to charm his way into people's hearts when the time is
right and most of the time, he gives one space when they need it. Just by discovering him,
my family and I are growing closer each day!
